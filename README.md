# Snippets
A collection of CSS / SCSS snippets that enhance Discord.

## Applying the Snippet(s)
For those who would like to use these in their themes (to publish): 
- You can copy-paste the code into your own source, where you want to put it. There are both CSS and SCSS versions, so choose whichever you'd like.
- Please give credit, just somewhere in the README or source is fine. If you want to be that one person and not give credit for something that's being provided to you for free, you do you I guess.
For the people who just want to use the snippet alone as is:
- You can either copy-paste the code into your quick CSS (only CSS is supported in these usually), or you can use the `@import` stuff in your quick CSS. 

## Issues
If you're having issues with a snippet, you can open an issue. Please make sure that you describe what snippet is exactly causing it, what's the issue and provide some screenshots. I also suggest that you add on what client mod you're using and what OS you're on.
